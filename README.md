# Path Language to Topic Maps Mapping Syntax

The "Path Language to Topic Maps Mapping Syntax (PLTTM)" defines a language to map 
serialized domain specific subject representations to Topic Maps equivalents. 
Therefore, PLTTM enables (semantic) data federation.

PLTTM uses path language statements e.g. in XPath  or JSONPath to address subject 
representations in e.g. XML or JSON serializations. The path language statements are 
furthermore used to extract the relevant portions of data.

PLTTM is inspired by "The Compact RDF to Topic Maps Mapping Syntax (CRTM)" and 
borrows the majority of syntactical constructs from it. Consequently, PLTTM is regarded 
as a side project of CRTM.
